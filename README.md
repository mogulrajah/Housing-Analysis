# Housing-Analysis
This project is ideal to demonstrates skills in data science, machine learning, and real-world problem-solving.

Objective: Predict housing prices based on features like room size neighbourhood, reviews, host name, id, amongst others.

Data Collection: Datasets was sourced from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies (e.g., incorrect entries for square footage or prices).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends (price vs. location, correlations between features) and identify key factors influencing prices (e.g., proximity to schools or metros).
